The smaller the bird, the crunchier it is ;)

### **Roast Little Auk Recipe**

This simple method brings out the natural flavors of the bird while preserving its tenderness.

#### **Ingredients:**

-   1 Little Auk (plucked and gutted)

-   2 tbsp olive oil or melted butter

-   1 tbsp fresh thyme or rosemary (or a mix of both)

-   2 cloves garlic, minced

-   Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste

-   1 lemon (cut into wedges)

-   1/2 cup white wine or chicken stock (optional, for basting)

#### **Instructions:**

1.  **Preparation:**

    -   Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).

    -   Rinse the Little Auk thoroughly and pat it dry with paper towels. Make sure the bird is cleaned and the innards are removed.

    -   Season the inside of the bird with salt, pepper, and a little thyme or rosemary.

2.  **Seasoning:**

    -   Rub the outside of the bird with olive oil or melted butter.

    -   Sprinkle the minced garlic, remaining thyme or rosemary, and a pinch of salt and pepper over the bird. You can also place a few sprigs of thyme or rosemary inside the cavity for added flavor.

3.  **Roasting:**

    -   Place the bird on a roasting rack or a baking dish. If you're using wine or chicken stock, pour it into the bottom of the dish for moisture and to prevent the bird from drying out.

    -   Roast the bird in the oven for about 25–30 minutes, depending on its size, or until the meat reaches an internal temperature of 160°F (71°C) when checked with a meat thermometer.

4.  **Serving:**

    -   Once the bird is roasted, remove it from the oven and let it rest for 5–10 minutes before carving.

    -   Serve the Little Auk with roasted vegetables, mashed potatoes, or a fresh salad. The bird's rich, gamey flavor pairs well with a citrusy garnish like lemon wedges.

### **Alternative Cooking Methods:**

-   **Grilling:** Marinate the bird in olive oil, herbs, and lemon juice for 1–2 hours before grilling it over medium heat.

-   **Stewing:** If you prefer a stew-like dish, simmer the bird with root vegetables and a flavorful broth for a more tender result.

### **Important Note:**

Before attempting to cook Little Auk or any other wild bird, always check the local regulations regarding hunting, harvesting, and cooking wild species. Many birds, including Little Auk, may be protected under international conservation agreements or national wildlife protection laws. Always ensure that the bird is sustainably sourced and that you are in compliance with local rules.
