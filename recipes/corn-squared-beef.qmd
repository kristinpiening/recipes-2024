    ::: callout-note
    **Corned beef**, **bully beef**, or **salt beef** in some [Commonwealth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Nations "Commonwealth of Nations") countries, is [salt-cured](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt-cured_meat "Salt-cured meat") [brisket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brisket "Brisket") of beef.^[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corned_beef#cite_note-1)^ The term comes from the treatment of the meat with large-grained [rock salt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_salt "Rock salt"), also called "corns" of [salt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt#Edible_salt "Salt"). Sometimes, [sugar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sugar "Sugar") and [spices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spice "Spice") are added to corned beef recipes. Corned beef is featured as an ingredient in many cuisines.

    ::: callout-note
    The optimum ratio is up to you but I prefer 1 can beef to 2 cans corn

Materials:

-   Camping stove
-   Pan
-   Mixing spoon
-   Can opener (very very important)

Instructions:

-   Put the corned beef into the pan on medium heat and allow it to warm/fry a bit (the beef is already cooked, it is just like a gross paste when it comes out)
-   Once the beef has started to dry out and fry, add the corn (you are just warming it up). Bonus points if you blackened the corn in another pan already- will add more pop/texture to the dish.
-   Serve!
