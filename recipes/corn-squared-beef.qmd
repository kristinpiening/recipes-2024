A warm dish perfect for when you only have canned goods available and need something warm to eat.

Ingredients:

-   Corned beef (must be from a can for full effect)

-   Corn (must be from a can for full effect

    ::: callout-note
    The optimum ratio is up to you but I prefer 1 can beef to 2 cans corn
    :::

Materials:

-   Camping stove
-   Pan
-   Mixing spoon
-   Can opener (very very important)

Instructions:

-   Put the corned beef into the pan on medium heat and allow it to warm/fry a bit (the beef is already cooked, it is just like a gross paste when it comes out)
-   Once the beef has started to dry out and fry, add the corn (you are just warming it up). Bonus points if you blackened the corn in another pan already- will add more pop/texture to the dish.
-   Serve!
