::: callout-note
In Europe itself there are different characteristics which can be found in the Hefezopf. In Bavaria for instance, particularly in the Upper Palatinate region, as per a local custom of Spitzlschenkens where by a Godfather, during the baptism gives an Allerheiligenspitzi, a large plait to his Godson. In Rhineland pretzel shaped bread plaits are served which carry fillings of almonds and granulated sugar. Saxony has its own tradition where there is a dish that goes by the name of Br√∂tchentei. It also involves both sweet yeast plaits and regular yeast plaits along with poppy fillings. In the upper Franconia region you can find Hefezopf usually in the form of a round egg shaped ring. It is a speciality during Easter in the region. (lots of information from ilikegermany.com)
