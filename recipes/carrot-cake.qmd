### Ingredients

::: {.callout-important appearance="minimal"}
The part of the carrot that we will be using here (the red-orange part) is a root of Wild carrot *Daucus carota*. However, whether something is a root or not is famously causing confusion among non-biologist type of folks. For example, if you type 'root' on your phone, Gboard will propose an emoji of ginger root. And that is not a root, not at all. It's a rhizome, which is actually a stem!

Know your roots, people!

**Dough:**

-   carrots (medium size) - 2

-   oil - 1 cup

-   eggs - 3

-   flour - 255 g

-   baking powder - 1.5 tea spoon

-   baking soda - 0.5 tea spoon

-   brow sugar - 1.5 cup

-   cinnamon - 1 tea spoon

-   pecan nuts - 200 grams

-   salt - just a pinch for the magic ;)

**Cream:**

-   cream cheese (the fluffy type like Almette )

-   powdered sugar - the original recipe said 120 grams, but it's way to much, I add 20 grams

-   butter - 50 g

-   orange juice - squeezed from a 0.25 of orange - or more, if you want it to be less solid/ more orangy

### Step by step

**Dough:**

1.  Mix eggs with sugar. Add oil and mix.

2.  In separate container mix flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt and cinnamon. Do the mixing with spoon, not with kitchen robot, otherwise everything will explode :)

3.  Mix the mixed stuff from the previous steps.

4.  Add grated carrot and (again) mix everything together with spoon

5.  Add chopped nuts and mix everything together.

6.  Put into baking tin on baking paper. Bake in 180 C for \~35 minutes

**Cream:**

1.  Melt the butter and wait for it to cool down a bit

2.  Mix butter with cream cheese, melted butter, powdered sugar and orange juice

3.  Put the cream on top on your baked cake, after it cools down

*SMACZNEGO!*
